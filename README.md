# HQAM
Code for the HQAM Text Analysis Project

The files in this repository contain both the code and data files used for the analysis.    

Currently, the code references my desktop location, and this will need to be changed to reference the correct location. 

Additionally, the 'TextPullandParse' code creates a folder on your computer and the directory will need to be updated to run.
